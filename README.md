# ST-DBSCAN

**Simple and effective method for spatial-temporal clustering**

*st_dbscan* is an open-source software package for the spatial-temporal clustering of movement data:

- Implemnted using `numpy` and `sklearn`
- Scales to memory - using chuncking sparse matrices and the `st_dbscan.fit_frame_split`

## Installation
The easiest way to install *st_dbscan* is by using `pip` :

    pip install st-dbscan

## How to use

### Import the library
```python
from st_dbscan import ST_DBSCAN
```

### Usage
Use by initializing the class and fitting the data.

Data shold be in the order `temporal, spatial_X, spatial_Y` (In other words, your time component must be the first item in the array)

```python
st_dbscan = ST_DBSCAN(eps1 = 0.05, eps2 = 10, min_samples = 5)
st_dbscan.fit(data)

```
